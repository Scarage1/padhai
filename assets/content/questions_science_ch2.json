      "options": ["Breaks down starch", "Breaks down proteins", "Breaks down fats", "Absorbs nutrients"],
      "correct_answer": "Breaks down starch",
      "explanation": "Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase (ptyalin) which breaks down starch into simpler sugars. Saliva also moistens food and makes it easier to swallow.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 15,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 14",
      "hint": "Think about what enzyme is present in saliva and what it acts on."

      "options": ["Small intestine", "Large intestine", "Stomach", "Esophagus"],
      "correct_answer": "Small intestine",
      "explanation": "The inner walls of the small intestine have thousands of finger-like projections called villi. These increase the surface area for absorption of digested food into the bloodstream.",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "points": 10,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 18",

      "question_type": "mcq",
      "options": ["Produces bile", "Produces insulin", "Stores food", "Absorbs water"],
      "correct_answer": "Produces bile",
      "explanation": "The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gall bladder. Bile helps in the digestion of fats by breaking them into smaller droplets (emulsification), making them easier to digest by enzymes.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 15,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 16",
      "hint": "This substance helps in breaking down fats."

      "correct_answer": "Canines",
      "explanation": "Canines are pointed teeth located next to incisors. They are used for tearing and piercing food. Carnivorous animals have well-developed canines for tearing meat.",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "points": 10,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 13",

      "options": ["Absorbs water", "Digests proteins", "Produces enzymes", "Stores bile"],
      "correct_answer": "Absorbs water",
      "explanation": "The large intestine's main function is to absorb water from the undigested food material. It also helps in the formation and storage of feces before elimination through the anus.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 15,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 19",
      "hint": "This process prevents dehydration and forms solid waste."

      "question_type": "mcq",
      "options": ["Pancreas", "Liver", "Stomach", "Spleen"],
      "correct_answer": "Pancreas",
      "explanation": "The pancreas produces pancreatic juice which contains enzymes like trypsin (for proteins), lipase (for fats), and pancreatic amylase (for starch). It is released into the small intestine.",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "points": 10,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 17",
      "hint": "This organ is located below the stomach."

      "question_type": "mcq",
      "options": ["By forming pseudopodia", "By filter feeding", "By photosynthesis", "By diffusion"],
      "correct_answer": "By forming pseudopodia",
      "explanation": "Amoeba engulfs food by forming finger-like projections called pseudopodia. The food is surrounded and taken in by the cell membrane to form a food vacuole. This process is called phagocytosis.",

      "correct_answer": "Acidic (pH 1-2)",
      "explanation": "Gastric juice in the stomach is highly acidic with a pH of about 1-2. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid (HCl) which kills bacteria and activates pepsin enzyme for protein digestion.",
      "difficulty": "advanced",
      "points": 20,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 15",
      "hint": "The stomach contains hydrochloric acid."

      "options": ["Cellulose digestion with help of bacteria", "Only protein digestion", "Only fat digestion", "No digestion occurs"],
      "correct_answer": "Cellulose digestion with help of bacteria",
      "explanation": "Ruminants like cows have a four-chambered stomach. Cellulose in grass is digested by bacteria present in the rumen. The partially digested food (cud) is brought back to the mouth for further chewing.",
      "difficulty": "advanced",
      "points": 20,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 20",

      "correct_answer": "Peristalsis",
      "explanation": "Peristalsis is the wave-like muscular contractions of the digestive tract that push food forward. It occurs in the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, ensuring food moves in one direction.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 15,
      "ncert_reference": "Chapter 2, Page 14",
